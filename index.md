I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute ([WPI](http://www.wpi.edu/)) and working in the Autonomy, Control, and Estimation Laboratory (ACEL) under supervision of Professor [Raghvendra V. Cowlagi](http://users.wpi.edu/~rvcowlagi/). I have general interests in robotics, real-time and embedded systems. My current research focus is on the sensing and motion planning of self-driving cars.

I received my Master's degree in Robotics Engineering from WPI in May, 2013. And I spent about two years working on the [DARPA Robotics Challenge](http://www.theroboticschallenge.org/) with Professor [Taskin Padir](http://www.ece.neu.edu/people/padir-taskin). Our [Team WPI-CMU](http://robot.wpi.edu/drc/) ranked 7th out of 23 competing teams in the DRC Finals.
