Robot Simulation Toolkit
======

This project aims at making a collection of tools for robot simulation. The project takes advantages of existing open-source libraries and frameworks, making modifications to best accommodate robotic applications. Currently V-REP is used for the physics-based simulation. G3LOG is integrated to provide the logging function for debugging and system performance evaluation. LCM and ROS are experimented to bridge different frameworks and provide access to various robotic packages. The following robot models are supported for use of research work in the lab: the 2-link Pelican experimental robot arm, the AscTec Hummingbird Quadrotor and an ackerman-steering RC car. For more information, refer to the [wiki page](http://wiki.rdu.im/_pages/Projects/Mobile-Robot-Toolkit/Mobile-Robot-Toolkit.html) of this project.
