Robotic System for Use of Fall Risk Assessment in Home Environment
======

Fall risks present in living environment are the leading cause of mortality in older adults. Limited number of trained professionals to assess a house for fall risks and higher costs make the prevention of fall risks inaccessible to many necessitous patients. This project focuses on the design of a robot control system for in-home environment screening. The system is designed to be capable of supporting both manual and autonomous fall-risk assessment, including measuring distance between 2 objects, assessing lighting conditions, and interacting with the patient using telepresence.
