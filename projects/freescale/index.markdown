High-Speed Trajectory Planning and Tracking of a RC Car
=====

This project originated from the Freescale Cup Intelligent Car Racing competition. The goal of this competition is to enable a RC car to follow guiding lines on a track and run as fast as possible. The track includes elements like long straight segment, S turns, crossing section, slope etc. All computation must be done onboard the RC car, which equips with a MCU as well as a camera or a set of binary sensors. The challenge is mainly from the requirement of high speed, with limited sensing and computation power.
