3D Visualization of a Simulated Robot
====

For a surgical robot, it's often desired to preview the planned operation virtually before actually asking the robot to operate on the patient. This project is to develop the visualization of a brain surgical robot built in the AIM lab at WPI. Basically there are two parts of work to be done to fulfill the needs: calculate the pose of each part of the robot at a specific configuration and visualize each part in a virtual scene. VTK was used for the visualization and other work were done in Java.
