Intelligent Portable Aerial Surveillance System â€“ IPASS
======

Intelligent Portable Aerial Surveillance System (IPASS) is aimed at developing a low-cost, light-weight unmanned aerial vehicle that can provide sufficient battlefield intelligence for individual troops. This project was defined as an addition and improvement to the original MQP project sponsored by the Air Force Research Laboratory. Instead of focusing on the mechanical design and system integration which were done by the IPASS team, this project concentrates on the system modeling, dynamic simulation and high-speed image stitching.
