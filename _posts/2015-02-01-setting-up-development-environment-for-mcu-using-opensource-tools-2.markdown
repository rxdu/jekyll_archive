I keep figure 1 from the first part of this article for easy reference. As introduced in part one, you will need to prepare source files, get startup code and a linker script first, then compile, assemble, link them to get an executable file, and finally convert the executable file to a binary file that your MCU can understand. In this part, I will explain how to do all these work more specifically.
