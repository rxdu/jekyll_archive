## Research Interests

My research interest is to study the control and motion planning of mobile robots to make them more reactive to obstacles and capable of making safe movements while not losing agileness in cluttered and dynamic environments. I'm also interested in thinking about problems like how to make a robot collaborate with humans and take advantage of both to perform challenging tasks.
