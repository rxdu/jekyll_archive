<a name="SKILLS"></a>

## <span style="color: CadetBlue ">TECHNICAL SKILLS</span>

* **Robotics**: modeling, simulation, control and motion planning of robots
* **Programming Languages**: C/C++, Matlab, Python
* **Software & Frameworks**: ROS, V-REP, Gazebo, LCM, Git, GCC, Qt, wxWidgets
* **Embedded Hardware**: Cortex-M3/M4, AVR, HCS12, MSP430, Raspberry Pi

I'm familiar with development in both Windows and Linux. A lot of my project development work is done in Ubuntu with C++ and ROS. I'm comfortable with using open-source tools, such as Eclipse and GNU toolchains, to do embedded development. I use Git a lot to manage both my personal projects and projects collaborating with others in the lab.
